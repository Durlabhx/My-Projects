# 📘 Version Control — Learning Projects Repository

This file tracks the evolution of all projects in this repository as part of my **learning journey**. Each version tag reflects meaningful updates such as new features, improvements, bug fixes, or transitions (e.g., from CLI to GUI).

🔖 Tag Format:  
`<language>-<project-name>-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

---

## ✅ Guidelines

- **Major (`v1.0.0 → v2.0.0`)**: Big changes like redesigns, GUI transitions, or complete module restructures.
- **Minor (`v1.0.0 → v1.1.0`)**: New features added to an existing version.
- **Patch (`v1.1.0 → v1.1.1`)**: Small improvements or bug fixes.

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is a **central hub** for all of my personal learning-based projects.
- All code has been written and improved by me — with help from open resources and AI tools for guidance and feedback.
- For major, production-ready, or unique tools in the future, I may create **separate repositories**.
